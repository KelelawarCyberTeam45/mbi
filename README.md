# Multi Brute Forcing Instagram
This tool is used to brute forcing Instagram accounts taken from searching names, grabbing usernames from hashtags, searching for random names. And you can use many names or hashtags so you can get multiple accounts, for example (joshua kelly, ezra bryant, lucas) or (#wwe, #world, #wonderfulworld) and the banner will change colors when the program is run. The Special thing about this tool is that we can immediately change the password to whatever we want, so we don't have to bother to log in to one account and change the password. This tool is accompanied by a Thread Pool Executor module so that programs made will be faster, this tool is made with the python programming language.
